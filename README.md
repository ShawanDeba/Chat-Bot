# Chatbot using Neural Networks
This is a project that aims to create a chatbot using neural networks. 
The chatbot will be able to engage in conversations with users and respond appropriately to their queries.

# Project Overview
The chatbot is developed using a neural network model that is trained on a large corpus of text data.
predefined data set of tokens of words and their sentiments are defined in sentiments.json
The model is trained to predict the next word in a sentence based on the context of the previous words.

Once the model is trained, it is integrated into a chatbot application that interacts with users through a user interface. 
The chatbot application receives user input, processes it, and generates a response based on the trained neural network model.

# Installation
To run this project, follow these steps:

1.Clone this repository to your local machine.
2.Install the required packages using pip install -r requirements.txt.
3.Download the text corpus(sentiments.json) dataset and store it in the data folder.
3.Run the train.py script to train the neural network model. Mentioned in ipynb file - 1st one
4.Run the chatbot.py script to start the chatbot application. Mentioned in ipynb file - 2nd one

# Usage
To use the chatbot, simply enter your queries in the user interface provided by the chatbot application. 
The chatbot will respond with appropriate answers based on the neural network model's predictions.
